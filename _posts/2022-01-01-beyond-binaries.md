This piece is motivated by my desire for scientific inquiry that is ethical and socially responsible. Simplistic binary thinking, which can both amplify and erase differences in harmful ways, can be challenged within scientific communities using both art and data approaches.

The ideas in this zine draw from my reflections as a researcher studying the biological basis of sex differences and are a response to the question “How can we queer science?”

Additionally, an alternative framework for understanding autism spectrum disorder outside the traditional “high functioning” and “low functioning” categories, offered by Hari Srinivasan in a Berkeley class on autism, inspired the theme. The zine format is great – approachable, fun, and cheap! – and I’ve found it’s an easy way to start a conversation about new ways to think and communicate about data.
