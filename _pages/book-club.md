The Data Science by Design community doesn't just publish books, we also read a lot of books together. We have a bi-weekly book club where we read and discuss books that we hope will inspire us and help us to develop a more open, ethical, inclusive, and creative future for the field of data science. We like to really dig in and take our time with the books we read, so we typically read a chapter or two every other week.

Just as we celebrate creativity in data science, we are creative in our book club selections. We’ve read books from data science professors and researchers, data artists, and books about understanding and making art.
