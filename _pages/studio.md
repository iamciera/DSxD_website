<H2> DSxD Studio </H2>

We are inspired by the studio as a space to experiment and learn as a collective of supportive makers. In the spirit of DSxD, we celebrate the fundamental creativity of data science by leveraging creative mediums, design thinking, and storytelling to deepen the practice and insights of data. Emerging organically from prior DSxD activities, we developed this idea for a distributed, safe studio space to collaborate on creative data projects and motivate each other to take creative risks. We value playful critique and active participation/engagement.

We meet every two weeks over Zoom, taking turns leading the group activity for the week, and then collectively producing some representation of that activity the following meeting two weeks later. These activities include interviewing data artists, presenting our own ideas for projects, and collaborating on fun projects together.

Our activities are centered around the ideas outlined in [the studio of habits of mind](https://pz.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/eight_habits_of_mind%20.pdf), such as understanding data and art worlds, developing craft, and engaging and persisting. Some example sessions could be learning about data art history, sharing a new technique with the group, and inspiring each other to move our passion projects forward. Essential to our practice are the ideas of process over product, playful critique, and inspiring each other to explore our creativity.
